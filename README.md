# My First Machine Learning Model

This is my first interaction with Machine Learning models. In this project, I have used the Diabetes dataset to build a linear regression model to predict disease progression based on various features.

## Project Description

In this project, I performed the following tasks:

- Loaded and explored the Diabetes dataset.
- Preprocessed the data by splitting it into training and test sets.
- Built a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
- Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualized the prediction errors using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with basic machine learning techniques and learn how to apply them to real-world data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Diabetes dataset** from the scikit-learn library. It contains data about patients and their features, with the target variable being the progression of diabetes after one year.

### Features:
- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **BMI**
- **Average blood pressure**
- **Six blood serum measurements** (related to diabetes)

### Target:
- **Disease progression** (Continuous variable)

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
